# Critical Development Guidelines

## Pre-Development Requirements
⚠️ **MANDATORY READING BEFORE CODING** ⚠️

1. Always read [architecture.md](mdc:architecture.md) before writing any code
   - Contains complete database schema
   - Defines system architecture
   - Specifies technical requirements
   - Outlines integration points

2. Always read [app-design-document.md](mdc:memory-bank/app-design-document.md) before writing any code
   - Contains application mechanics
   - Defines user experience
   - Specifies feature requirements
   - Outlines design principles

## Post-Development Requirements
After completing major features or milestones:

1. Update [architecture.md](mdc:architecture.md) with:
   - Any schema changes
   - New technical decisions
   - Updated architecture diagrams
   - New integration points
   - Performance considerations

## Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Include clear explanations for architectural decisions
- Document any deviations from original design
- Update affected components in documentation

For detailed configuration, see [Tech-stack.md](mdc:memory-bank/Tech-stack.md)
